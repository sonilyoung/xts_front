### Name Derived From Nature

Mantis Logo is inspired from the insect name - 'Mantises' as they have triangular heads with flexible Necks. Also, the name is derived from two popular UI frameworks, Material UI and Ant Design (M-Ant-is).

Mantis has Ant Design principal on top of the MAterial UI React component library.
